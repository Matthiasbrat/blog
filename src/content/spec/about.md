# About me
Hi, my name is Matthias Brat. I'm european, swiss, belgian and french.<br/>
My native language is french, but I also speak german, dutch and english.<br/>

# Why ?

I wanted a little space for me to write some things.<br/>
People today tend to have strong oppinions about each other. This blog is me, doesn't matter if you like it or not, how you see me, what you think of me.<br/>
I judge people by their actions, not by their looks, neither by their yapping.<br/>
