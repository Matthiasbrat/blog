# About me
Hi, my name is Matthias Brat. I'm european, swiss, belgian and french.<br/>
My native language is french, but I also speak german, dutch and english.<br/>

# What I like
I've always enjoyed understanding things; fully. Thus, I like reading/writing documentation.
> What people don't really understand is that the group of people who write a doc consider:
> + Readability
> + Organization
> + Clarity
> + etc
> 
> But everyone prefers to read some 1 guy opinion on the matter in a stackoverflow thread ðŸ˜…. 

# Why ?

I wanted a little space for me to write some things.<br/>
People today tend to have strong oppinions about each other. This blog is me, doesn't matter if you like it or not, how you see me, what you think of me.<br/>
I judge people by their actions, not by their looks, neither by their <abbr title="talking a lot in a foolish or irritating way">yapping</abbr>.
