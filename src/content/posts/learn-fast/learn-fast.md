# Context
I've been studying on my own for several years now and I wanted to share some of the documentation I've written since.

# Why ?
* 🚀 I write my own documentation because I want it to be concise, fast and cover the basic or in-depth aspects of any subject I study.
* 🐢 I want to help new programmers around me learn in a more efficient way than watching 10 hours of tutorials every day.
* ❤ I love writing.
